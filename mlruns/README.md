## MLflow Runs Folder

This folder contains the MLflow runs generated by your machine learning experiments. Each run is stored in a subfolder with a unique ID.

Within each run subfolder, you will find the following files:

* **artifacts**: This folder contains any artifacts generated by the run, such as model files, metrics, and logs.
* **config.yaml**: This file contains the configuration parameters for the run.
* **metrics.json**: This file contains the metrics recorded during the run.
* **params.yaml**: This file contains the parameters passed to the run.
* **tags.yaml**: This file contains any tags associated with the run.

You can use the MLflow CLI or Python API to interact with these runs. For example, you can use the following command to list all runs:

```bash
mlflow runs list
```

Or, you can use the following Python code to get the details of a specific run:

```python
import mlflow

run = mlflow.get_run(run_id="...")
```
