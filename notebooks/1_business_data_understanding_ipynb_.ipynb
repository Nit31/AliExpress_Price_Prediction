Employing a straightforward MLP architecture with hidden layers of sizes 512 and 64 yielded promising results, achieving an R-squared value of approximately 0.8 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) around 27. These metrics underscore the feasibility of leveraging machine learning for our project goals. However, significant challenges were encountered during data cleaning, highlighting the problem of raw data. We could achieve these promising results only after cutting the products with number of sell under 20 and stores with number of products less than 5."
