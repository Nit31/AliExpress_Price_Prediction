# src 

This folder contains the source code for the project's data management and validation functionalities.

## File Structure:

* *`data.py`:* This module provides functions for:
    * *Data Sampling* 
    * *Data Validation*
* *`__pycache__/`:*  This directory stores compiled Python bytecode files (`.pyc` files) generated by Python for faster execution.  It's automatically generated and managed by Python.
* *`__init__.py`:*  This file makes Python treat the "src" folder as a package, allowing you to import modules from it in other parts of your project.

## Notes:

* The functions in `data.py` are designed to be called by scripts or other modules within the project.
* You may need to install required dependencies before using the functions in `data.py`. Refer to the project documentation or requirements files for more information.
